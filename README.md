### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nguyá»…n Tiáº¿n Khang, I'm currently studying Computer Science at Ho Chi Universty of Technology. 

ðŸ”­ I'm thoroughly interested in fields related to Data Engineering and System Development, more specifically I focus on:
  - System Design & Analysis: Crafting robust and efficient system architectures.
  - Data Mining: Managing and exploring patterns and insights from complex data.
  - App Development: Building solutions for Windows and Android platforms.


ðŸŒ± In terms of personal skills:
  - I'm highly proficient in Python Programming, which I very often use for Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Back-end development, Data Analysis and other computing-related tasks
  - I'm also skilled in C++ programming, leveraging its power for algorithm design, high-performance computing and competitive programming.
  - I also take a keen interest in PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and various Data Visualization tools such as PowerBI and Tableau.
  - I also use C whenever I need to have a look at some low-level tasks. In the near future, I'm  considering Rust for knowledge widening.
  - Though not virtuous in Computing systems, I have a firm background on Security and Modern Computing.
    
If you ever want to collaborate with me on any projects, please contact me at these 2 addreses:
