### Hi there 👋
My name is Nguyễn Tiến Khang, I'm currently studying Computer Science at Ho Chi Universty of Technology. 

🔭 I'm thoroughly interested in fields related to Machine Learning and Optimization, more specifically my fields of interests/research are:
  - Supervised Learning
  - Optimization Algorithms and Applications in Finance and Logistics
  - Data Science
  - Data Security (in Large-Scale Systems)
  - Applied Cryptography 


🌱 In terms of personal skills:
  - I'm highly proficient in Python Programming, which I very often use for Machine Learning, Statistical Computing, Back-end development and other computing-related tasks
  - I'm also skilled in C++ programming, leveraging its power for algorithm design, high-performance computing and competitive programming.
  - I also take a keen interest in MySQL, MongoDB and Oracle SQL.
  - I also use C whenever I need to have a look at some low-level tasks. In the near future, I'm  considering Rust for knowledge widening.
  - Though not virtuous in Computing systems, I have a firm background on Security and Modern Computing.
    
If you ever want to collaborate with me on any projects, please contact me at these 2 addreses:
